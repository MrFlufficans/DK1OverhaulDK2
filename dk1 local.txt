@firearm_686_plus_revolver_desc=Having no moving slide, revolvers offer\nthe distinct advantage of being able to\nmaneuver and shoot in very tight spaces,\nwithout maiming yourself or getting a jam.\n\nHowever, the real reason to get a Magnum\nrevolver is so you can ask some poor soul:\n\n       'Do you feel lucky, punk?'

@firearm_686_plus_revolver_1h_desc=Having no moving slide, revolvers offer\nthe distinct advantage of being able to\nmaneuver and shoot in very tight spaces,\nwithout maiming yourself or getting a jam.\n\nThis also applies to using shields, and the\nrevolver can even be shot when literally\ntouching the shield viewport.

@firearm_hk45_pistol_name=HK45 Pistol
@firearm_hk45_pistol_desc=The powerful .45 ACP and all the modern\ndesign features, whats not to like? The HK\nboasts extreme accuracy and high magazine\ncapacity - for a 45 that is.\n\nNot the best pistol for recoil control and\nfollow-up shots, but a solid performer in\nany situation.
@firearm_hk45sd_pistol_name=HK45-SD Pistol
@firearm_hk45sd_pistol_desc=The slow moving .45 slug is the ideal\ncartridge to suppress, and an accurate\npistol doubles its value.\n\nA great conversation starter if there ever\nwas one.\n\nSound Travel Range: 6m
@firearm_revolver_38_special_name=Revolver (.38 Special)
@firearm_fs_ap_pistol_name=FS AP Pistol
@firearm_fs_ap_pistol_desc=A handgun shooting the same armor piercing\nrounds as the P90 PDW, the FS will easily\ndefeat level IIIA body armor and shields.\n\nThe low bullet mass makes for controllable,\ntarget-pistol-like recoil but does not\nfavorize stopping power. Factor in the flat\nlong range trajectory and you might have a\ngreat specialist item.
@firearm_magnum_44_revolver_name=Magnum 44 Revolver
@firearm_magnum_44_revolver_desc=There's not much you can carry on duty more\npowerful than this Magnum 44 - at least if\nyou intend to keep your badge.\n\nSized right for quick shots at close range,\nthe 44 is powerful enough to quickly end\nfights and make a mess of the coroner's\nwork, but will leave you exposed when\nlonger shots are needed.

@firearm_magnum_44_revolver_1h_desc=There's not much you can carry on duty more\npowerful than this Magnum 44 - at least if\nyou intend to keep your badge.\n\nSized right for quick shots at close range,\nthe 44 is powerful enough to quickly end\nfights and make a mess of the coroner's\nwork, but will leave you exposed when\nlonger shots are needed.
@firearm_mark_23_pistol_name=Mark 23 Pistol
@firearm_mark_23_pistol_desc=The great .45 pistol of the late 90s, the\nMark 23 is extremely accurate, powerful\nand just too damn big.\n\nMore of a collectors item than a practical\nhandgun - unless your job description\nincludes crawling through hell and knocking\nheads at 50 yards, that is.
@firearm_mark_23sd_pistol_name=Mark 23-SD Pistol
@firearm_mark_23sd_pistol_desc=With its elevated sights and slow moving\nslugs, the Mark 23 is uniquely suited for\nthe role of silent sentry remover.\n\nSuperb accuracy makes for a first shot that\nalways counts and the weight actually helps\nwith controlling recoil for followup shots.\n\nSound Travel Range: 6m
@firearm_sp01_shadow_pistol_name=SP01 Shadow Pistol
@firearm_sp01_shadow_pistol_desc=A target-grade 9mm with the mag capacity\nfor those that just don't care for reloading,\nthe Shadow was built with the needs of Tac\nTeams and race shooters alike in mind:\n\nSpeed, Accuracy and Rate of Fire limited\nby shooter skill and training only.
@firearm_veterinary_pistol_name=Veterinary Pistol
@firearm_veterinary_pistol_desc=Built to humanely dispatch wounded animals\nbut bearing obvious World War 2 lineage, the\nVP is also a great 2-legged Pest Remover.\n\nThe ported barrel and bolt action operation\neliminate all practical sound report, along\nwith any dream of rapid fire.\n\nSound Travel Range: 1.5m

@firearm_mac_10_smg_name=Mac-10 SMG (Auto / 9mm)
@firearm_mac_10_smg_desc=
@firearm_mp5a3_smg_name=Mp5A3 SMG
@firearm_mp5a3_smg_desc=Very accurate and quick on the target at\nCQB ranges, the classic Mp5 is a favorite\nof SWAT teams all around the world.\n\n9MM burst fire out of a SMG barrel is\nplenty of stopping power, but the reload\ncontrols are somewhat archaic.
@firearm_mp5k_pdw_name=MP5K PDW (Auto / 9mm)
@firearm_evo_3_smg_name=Evo 3 SMG
@firearm_evo_3_smg_desc=Europeans love their SMGs and the rapid-\nfiring, compact Evo 3 is a great example.\n\nFast on the target and quick to fill it with\n9mm holes, it mixes European and American-\nstyle controls intelligently and can be\nrun and reloaded very efficiently.\n\nOverall one hell of a bang for your buck.
@firearm_bren_a1_assault_rifle_name=Bren A1 Assault Rifle
@firearm_bren_a1_assault_rifle_desc=A newcomer polymer assault rifle from\nCentral Europe, the Bren will do the job\nbut not break the bank.\n\nBetter than average long range accuracy is\nowed to the modular stock, but controls and\noverall layout make the Bren relatively\nslow in practical operation.
@firearm_ump45_smg_name=UMP45 SMG
@firearm_ump45_smg_desc=The UMP fires the reliable .45 ACP and does\nit with German accuracy, providing the\nhighest stopping power you can get in a\nSMG package.\n\nA bit large and unwieldy for most users,\nand the heavy recoil affects follow-up\nshots speed and accuracy.
@firearm_mp5a3_sd_smg_name=Mp5A3-SD SMG
@firearm_mp5a3_sd_smg_desc=Mounting a 7 inch suppressor on your Mp5A3\nmight not be the best way to maintain CQB\nmaneuverability, but will lower shot sound\nlevels by a decent number of decibels.\n\nThe weapon loses some accuracy but in\npractical terms effects are negligible.\n\nSound Travel Range: 10m
@firearm_ump45_sd_smg_name=UMP45-SD SMG
@firearm_ump45_sd_smg_desc=Mounting a suppressor on the UMP45 is\nstraightforward and efficient, as long as\nyou accept handling a 16 inch barrel SMG.\n\nVery deadly at close range and against bad\nguys not wearing armor.\n\nSound Travel Range: 5m
@firearm_mp5sd3_smg_name=Mp5SD3 SMG
@firearm_mp5sd3_smg_desc=The quietest submachinegun at your disposal,\nthe Mp5SD uses barrel ports and an integral\nsuppressor to lower the velocity of the\nround down to subsonic levels.\n\nYou'll still hear the sound of the bolt\ncycling, but you won't know it's a weapon.\n\nSound Travel Range: 2.5m
@firearm_mp7sd_smg_name=MP7-SD SMG
@firearm_mp7sd_smg_desc=The small and maneuverable Mp7 shoots tiny\nbullets, but the low recoil and flat, rifle-\nlike trajectory translate into quick and\naccurate bursts of fire even at long range.\n\nThose tiny bullets do punch through kevlar\nwith ease, even when suppressed.\n\nSound Travel Range: 4m
@firearm_m4_carabine_name=M4 Carbine
@firearm_m4_carabine_desc=Battle proven beyond doubt, the M4 is quick\non the target and accurate at all practical\nranges.\n\nThe 14.5 inch barrel doesn't make for the\nmost maneuverable weapon in CQB spaces, but\nensures reliable bullet fragmentation and\nstopping power.
@firearm_m4_cqbr_name=M4 CQB-R (Auto / 5.56mm)
@firearm_mpx_40_smg_name=MPX .40 SMG
@firearm_mpx_40_smg_desc=A modern submachinegun with AR15-style\ncontrols, the MPX is fast in operation and\nvery maneuverable in close spaces.\n\nHigh Rate of Fire coupled with decent\nstopping power make this a reliable fight\nstopper until the bad guys start donning\nbody armor.
@firearm_mp7_pdw_name=Mp7 PDW
@firearm_mp7_pdw_desc=The small and maneuverable Mp7 shoots tiny\nbullets, but the low recoil and flat, rifle-\nlike trajectory translate into quick and\naccurate bursts of fire even at long range.\n\nThose tiny bullets punch through Low Threat\nvests with ease, but compared with pistol\ncaliber SMGs you are giving away some first\nshot stopping power.
@firearm_p90_pdw_name=P90 PDW
@firearm_p90_pdw_desc=A compact Personal Defense Weapon shooting\na high velocity intermediate round, the P90\nis great for Close Quarters Combat and will\npierce straight through level IIIA armor.\n\nThe flat trajectory of the 5.7mm is great\nfor mid-to-long range shots, but stopping\npower potential is less than that of SMGs\nshooting traditional calibers.
@firearm_g36c_assault_rifle_name=G36C Assault Rifle
@firearm_g36c_assault_rifle_desc=A favorite of European SWAT teams, the G36C\nis short, light and very maneuverable.\n\nThe short barrel comes at the expense of\nstopping power though, as the low muzzle\nvelocity cuts under the reliable frag-\nmentation threshold for 5.56 rounds.
@firearm_mk16_pdw_name=Mk 16 PDW
@firearm_mk16_pdw_desc=This ultra compact PDW is handy in close\nquarters or when concealment is needed.\n\nIts small size makes it quick to get into\naction but the skeleton stock is a poor\nshooting platform, so accuracy and recoil\ncontrol are sub-standard.\n\nNot recommended for hostage rescue work.
@firearm_hk416d10_name=HK416D10 Carbine
@firearm_hk416d10_desc=The German engineering take on the AR15,\nthe HK416 is a favorite of Tier 1 Special\nOperation Groups and armchair commandos\nworldwide.\n\nVery reliable and accurate, in the 10 inch\nbarrel version it's also maneuverable but\na little slow on the target due to the heavy\nrail.
@firearm_commando_553_name=Commando 553
@firearm_commando_553_desc=Another European carbine built to very\nhigh standards, the 553 is accurate and\nmaneuverable, but falls behind on stopping\npower due to the short barrel.\n\nGood balance makes it easy to reload and\nrecover from dropping the barrel in a tight\nspot.
@firearm_vector_smg_name=Vector SMG
@firearm_vector_smg_desc=The avant-garde Vector SMG masters the\npowerful .45 rounds by clever positioning\nof shooter hands and directing the bolt to\nrecoil downards.\n\nResulting recoil is very mild and allows\nimpressive 2 round bursts grouping, but the\nshort barrel makes for less spectacular\nfirst round accuracy.
@firearm_mk17_long_barrel_name=Mk 17 Long Barrel
@firearm_mk17_long_barrel_desc=When long range semi-auto fire is needed,\nthere's nothing quite like the big old 7.62\nto hit them with. When these rounds connect,\ntargets go down, but practical rate of fire\nis limited by the strong recoil.\n\nThe Mk 17 has AR-like controls and ergonomy\nin operation, but the long barrel hinders\nshort range maneuverability and efficiency.
@firearm_sar18_bullpup_name=SAR-18 Bullpup
@firearm_sar18_bullpup_desc=With an 18 inch barrel and an overall length\nof 27.5, the SAR is a great mix of accuracy,\nstopping power and maneuverabilty.\n\nThe placement of the magazine well to the\nrear slows down reloads considerably,\nthough, and weight is a bit on the high side.
@firearm_ak47_rifle_name=AK-47 Rifle (Semi / 7.62mm)
@firearm_ak47_drum_name=AK-47 Drum (Auto / 7.62mm)
@firearm_sniper_rifle_name=SniperRifle
@firearm_p90sd_pdw_name=P90-SD PDW
@firearm_p90sd_pdw_desc=The P90 is a great submachinegun for most\nurban engagements, but suppressing it does\nnot cover the supersonic crack of its high\nvelocity rounds.\n\nUsing subsonic ammo would negate the issue,\nbut would also lose most platform traits.\n\nSound Travel Range: 10m
@firearm_mpxsd_40_smg_name=MPX-SD .40 SMG
@firearm_mpxsd_40_smg_desc=The integrally suppressed version of the\nMPX is a joy to operate in combat thanks to \nthe AR-15 style controls.\n\nSubsonic .40 rounds don't pack that much of\na punch, but with the right training will\nmake short work of bad guy groups.\n\nSound Travel Range: 3m
@firearm_vectorsd_smg_name=Vector-SD SMG
@firearm_vectorsd_smg_desc=Suppressing .45 SMGs is a no-brainer and\nthe Vector's can has excellent signature\nreduction and zero effect on accuracy.\n\nYou'll appreciate the deadly bursts on\ntargets at close to medium range, but watch\nout for armored bad guys.\n\nSound Travel Range: 4m
@firearm_hk416d10sd_carabine_name=HK416D10-SD Carbine
@firearm_hk416d10sd_carabine_desc=Attaching a suppressor to a Short Barrel\nRifle is not optimal but does reduce the\nsound signature a little bit while keeping\nthe long range accuracy and lethality.\n\nYou best keep the increased barrel length\nin mind when navigating interior spaces.\n\nSound Travel Range: 13m
@firearm_honey_badger_name=Honey Badger
@firearm_honey_badger_desc=A great mix of ballistic performance, small\nsize and excellent sound suppression, the\nHoney Badger might gain a permanent spot in\nthe hands of Tier 1 Special Forces.\n\nArmor penetration is not great though, only\nmarginally better than pistol-caliber SMGs.\n\nSound Travel Range: 3.5m
@firearm_fal_mini_osw_name=FAL Mini OSW (Auto / 7.62mm)
@firearm_mp9_smg_name=MP9 SMG (Auto / 6.5mm AP)
@firearm_x635_pdw_name=X635 PDW
@firearm_x635_pdw_desc=A PDW boasting carbine-like ballistics,\nthe X635 shoots a 6mm cartridge designed to\nperform best out of short barrels and\nhalve recoil compared to classic M4s.\n\nShort enough to go through doorframes with\nlittle fuss, this classic styled PDW keeps\nlong range accuracy with no practical loss\nin stopping power.
@firearm_mcx300_carbine_name=MCX 300 Carbine
@firearm_mcx300_carbine_desc=Mixing AR-like controls with folding stock\ncompatible internals and designed for the\npowerful 300 Blackout cartridge, the MCX\nhandles right for close quarter ops and\ntakes down targets reliably.\n\nA great performer up to medium range, but\nloses aiming speed as you go farther.

# equipment_shotguns.xml
@firearm_breacher_shotgun_name=Breacher Shotgun
@firearm_breacher_shotgun_desc=The shortest pump shotgun available to you,\nit's quick to get into action and quick to\nsetup for door breaching.\n\nThe short length comes at a price though,\nas the magazine barely tackles one lock\nbefore running out of ammo.\n\n
@firearm_m870_room_clearer_name=M870 Room Clearer
@firearm_m870_room_clearer_desc=Sized just right for prolonged indoor\nadventures, the Room Cleaner comes with a\nhealthy magazine capacity and allows side-\nstepping through a door opening in ready\nposition.\n\nShot dispersion is still an issue so take\nextra care around hostages and fellow\nofficers.
@firearm_m590_shotgun_name=M590 Shotgun
@firearm_m590_shotgun_desc=The standard and dependable pump-action\nshotgun in Police inventory, the M590 comes\nwith great mag capacity but suffers in CQB\nspaces due to the long and unwieldy barrel.\n\nAs with all shotguns, keep in mind shot\ndispersion and target background.
@firearm_joint_combat_shotgun_name=Joint Combat Shotgun
@firearm_joint_combat_shotgun_desc=A Semi-Automatic shotgun in the familiar\ntube-fed design, the JCS is fun to shoot and\ngreat for pure short range firepower.\n\nNot the shortest boomstick around, though,\nso you'll need to support the breacher with\nanother trooper. Also, the mag goes empty\nfaster than you'd think.
@firearm_m26_lss_name=M26 LSS
@firearm_m26_lss_desc=Straight from the inventory of US Special\nForces, a magazine fed, bolt action shotgun.\n\nSurprisingly easy to charge but a little\nunwieldy in room clearing due to the awk-\nward hand positioning on the operating bolt,\nthe M26 is still a solid performer at close\nrange.
@firearm_sawnoff_shotgun_name=Sawn-Off Shotgun (12 Ga)
@firearm_ksg_shotgun_name=KSG Shotgun
@firearm_ksg_shotgun_desc=A very avant-garde design for a pump-action\nshotgun, the KSG uses twin tubular magazines\nto hold a whooping 14 shells.\n\nThe bullpup form maximizes maneuverability\nand accuracy, at the expense of awkward\nreloads and access to the ejection port.\n\nCannot use Ejection Port Reload doctrine.
@firearm_six12_shotgun_name=Six 12 Shotgun
@firearm_six12_shotgun_desc=The Six 12 is really a large, double-action\nrevolver that fires shotgun shells.\n\nSimple and revolutionary at the same time,\nthe design makes for quick reloads as long\nas you can juggle with the cylinders.\n\nCannot use Ejection Port Reload doctrine.
@firearm_six12sd_shotgun_name=Six 12-SD Shotgun
@firearm_six12sd_shotgun_desc=The shorter and suppressed version of the\nSix 12, not really that silent but useful\nto open doors without waking up the entire\ncity block.\n\nSound Travel Range: 10m\n\nCannot use Ejection Port Reload doctrine.
@firearm_s12k_tactical_shotgun_name=S12K Tactical Shotgun
@firearm_s12k_tactical_shotgun_desc=Policing the streets of Nowhere City USA\nwhile carrying an AK, that won't be easy to\nsell to the top brass.\n\nStill, the S12 is a dependable, magazine-fed\nshotgun in assault rifle format. Just\nremember that the format in question has\nthe control levers in all the wrong places!
