[This is previewable in VSCode with the 'Open Preview To The Side Button' in the top right of the editor.]

**Why did i make this?**

The commit names were generally pretty shit. I am not going to lie. 'Test' and 'Commit' are not readable and do not convey the purpose of the commit, and most of the commits come from anthony, whose commits name are full of this. Fluffys commit names are much better, though they dont include a description of what they did.

**Starting from now, i will maintain this, i recommend you to do the same.**
