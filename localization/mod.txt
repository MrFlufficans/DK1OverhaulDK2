@SWAT_firearm_mp5a3_smg_desc=Very accurate and quick on the target at\nCQB ranges, the classic Mp5 is a favorite\nof SWAT teams all around the world.\n\n9MM burst fire out of a SMG barrel is\nplenty of stopping power, but the reload\ncontrols are somewhat archaic.
@SWAT_firearm_mp5a3_sd_smg_desc=Mounting a 7 inch suppressor on your Mp5A3\nmight not be the best way to maintain CQB\nmaneuverability, but will lower shot sound\nlevels by a decent number of decibels.\n\nThe weapon loses some accuracy but in\npractical terms effects are negligible.\n\nSound Travel Range: 10m
@SWAT_firearm_m4_carabine_desc=Battle proven beyond doubt, the M4 is quick\non the target and accurate at all practical\nranges.\n\nThe 14.5 inch barrel doesn't make for the\nmost maneuverable weapon in CQB spaces, but ensures reliable bullet fragmentation and\nstopping power.
@SWAT_firearm_m590_shotgun_desc=The standard and dependable pump-action\nshotgun in Police inventory, the M590 comes\nwith great mag capacity but suffers in CQB\nspaces due to the long and unwieldy barrel.\n\nAs with all shotguns, keep in mind shot\ndispersion and target background.
@SWAT_firearm_joint_combat_shotgun_desc=A Semi-Automatic shotgun in the familiar\ntube-fed design, the JCS is fun to shoot and\ngreat for pure short range firepower.\n\nNot the shortest boomstick around, though,\nso you'll need to support the breacher with\nanother trooper. Also, the mag goes empty\nfaster than you'd think.
@SWAT_firearm_g17_pistol_desc=A high capacity 9mm sidearm, the perfect\ncompanion when you know how to hit the\nsoft spots.\n\nLow in the hand and shooting 'just' 9mm, the\nG17 offers great recoil control to deliver\nmultiple shots.


@SWAT_firearm_ksg_shotgun_desc=A very avant-garde design for a pump-action\nshotgun, the KSG uses twin tubular magazines to hold a whooping 14 shells.\n\nThe bullpup form maximizes maneuverability and accuracy, at the expense of awkward\nreloads and access to the ejection port.\n\nCannot use Ejection Port Reload doctrine.
@SWAT_firearm_honey_badger_desc=A great mix of ballistic performance, small\nsize and excellent sound suppression, the\nHoney Badger might gain a permanent spot in the hands of Tier 1 Special Forces.\n\nArmor penetration is not great though, only\nmarginally better than pistol-caliber SMGs.\n\nSound Travel Range: 3.5m
@SWAT_firearm_mpx_40_smg_desc=A modern submachinegun with AR15-style\ncontrols, the MPX is fast in operation and\nvery maneuverable in close spaces.\n\nHigh Rate of Fire coupled with decent\nstopping power make this a reliable fight\nstopper until the bad guys start donning\nbody armor.
@SWAT_firearm_g36c_assault_rifle_desc=A favorite of European SWAT teams, the G36C is short, light and very maneuverable.\n\nThe short barrel comes at the expense of\nstopping power though, as the low muzzle\nvelocity cuts under the reliable frag-\nmentation threshold for 5.56 rounds.
@SWAT_firearm_mcx300_carbine_desc=Mixing AR-like controls with folding stock\ncompatible internals and designed for the\npowerful 300 Blackout cartridge, the MCX\nhandles right for close quarter ops and\ntakes down targets reliably.\n\nA great performer up to medium range, but\nloses aiming speed as you go farther.
