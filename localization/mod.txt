@SWAT_firearm_ksg_shotgun_desc=A very avant-garde design for a pump-action\nshotgun, the KSG uses twin tubular magazines\nto hold a whooping 14 shells.\n\nThe bullpup form maximizes maneuverability\nand accuracy, at the expense of awkward\nreloads and access to the ejection port.\n\nCannot use Ejection Port Reload doctrine.
@SWAT_firearm_honey_badger_desc=A great mix of ballistic performance, small\nsize and excellent sound suppression, the\nHoney Badger might gain a permanent spot in\nthe hands of Tier 1 Special Forces.\n\nArmor penetration is not great though, only\nmarginally better than pistol-caliber SMGs.\n\nSound Travel Range: 3.5m
@SWAT_firearm_mpx_40_smg_desc=A modern submachinegun with AR15-style\ncontrols, the MPX is fast in operation and\nvery maneuverable in close spaces.\n\nHigh Rate of Fire coupled with decent\nstopping power make this a reliable fight\nstopper until the bad guys start donning\nbody armor.
@SWAT_firearm_g36c_assault_rifle_desc=A favorite of European SWAT teams, the G36C\nis short, light and very maneuverable.\n\nThe short barrel comes at the expense of\nstopping power though, as the low muzzle\nvelocity cuts under the reliable frag-\nmentation threshold for 5.56 rounds.
@SWAT_firearm_mcx300_carbine_desc=Mixing AR-like controls with folding stock\ncompatible internals and designed for the\npowerful 300 Blackout cartridge, the MCX\nhandles right for close quarter ops and\ntakes down targets reliably.\n\nA great performer up to medium range, but\nloses aiming speed as you go farther.
